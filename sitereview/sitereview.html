		<h2> <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a></h2>
<p>Twitter is the website I use most. One of the leading social media sites, it’s sleek and sophisticated design is hard to beat. The page has just one content bar in the middle to scroll down on and see people’s tweets, and the bars on the left and right don’t impose too much. It’s simple and effective. The color scheme is easy on the eyes, mainly white with a light bluish- grey background, and light blue text here and there, really give it a pristine feeling. Nothing feels crowded and everything has room to breath. The code is surely complicated and sophisticated, as it probably takes a lot to get everything on here running smoothly. The site is easy to understand and use. The icons and smooth and aesthetically pleasing, and rounded buttons and corners make the site feel welcoming. The color design allows for any theme to match well with it, since there’s such a vast variety of content on the platform.</p>
		<h2> <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/">Newgrounds</a></h2>
<p>Newgrounds is a site that’d been around for 20 years. It holds onto its older day aesthetics while still feeling like it has adapted with the times. The containing elements have rounded corners and everything has a black and orange aesthetic to give the place a chill vibe. The front page, while admittedly a little cluttered, has plenty of content to pic from. The site is for sharing animation and games that the users have created so this is the way to go. The background image is usually a giant cartoon drawing that matches this audience, and gets people excited about the fun content they might find on this site. The code is surprisingly short, while still intricate.</p>
		<h2> <a href="http://art.yale.edu/">Yale University School of Art</a></h2>
<p>You think the front page for a professional school of art would be more aesthetically pleasing, but this place is an assault on the senses. The first thing to catch your eye is probably going to be the flashing gif background, which rapidly swaps between images before giving your eyes a moment’s rest on whatever its trying to look at. The text looks boring and the links are the default. The navigation bar is as basic and simple as you can get: black arial font on a white background. The content in the middle of the screen (which is centered grossly off to the side) is smattered with eyesores one can only assume are to be considered “art.” The code is really short, so it’s easy to pick things out; I see a google analytics link. Overall it’s a pretty sucky site. The color pallete is drab, with the predominantly gray images in the background and the white with black text elements. There’s a bold choice of semi transparent green-to-white and yellow-to-white gradient elements at the top, which match the sickening feeling I get when looking at this web page.</p>
